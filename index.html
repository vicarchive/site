<h2>Welcome to Vic's Archive, the third and hopefully final iteration.</h2>
  <p>My name is Vic, and I'm a forever coding noob trying to make a website via html because I definitely have nothing better to do. I'm reworking the layout so I can ruin everything with css later. I'm also a college student with awful video game interests and an unfortunate ability to draw.</p>
    <p>This serves more as a blog or recording of what I do in my spare time that I wish to show off. I'll link it, but my Carrd is more for social links and redirects to other things.</p>
