<h2>Landing Page</h2>
<p>You've landed somewhere dark and disgusting. Welcome to Vic's Archive, the third and hopefully final iteration.</p>
  <h3>Some backstory:</h3>
  <p>Sometimes whatever they offer just doesn't do it. 1GB of space on Neocities where I can barely code and it's too slow and weird, limited elements in Carrd in which I can't really fully make it my own - sometimes you gotta take things into your own hands. So now this site exists.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm dogshit at html so the site will probably just end up looking like this forever. Have fun.</p>
  <p>Planned pages: music stuff; my own stuff maybe</p>
