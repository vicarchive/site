welcome to my website!! i wanted a place where i could add in my work in a way i wanted to without space restrictions or premade templates, and as a bonus i get to learn html, css and js!! and maybe some more sql..
the large commit number is from the early development cuz i was editing stuff directly on github. i use aptana studio 3 now :D

## Website Plans
### Plans:
- themes for the website:
  - dreamcast web browser (index) https://youtu.be/oL1Pxek3sss @ 0:18
  - myspace (profile) https://spacehey.com/profile?id=2620231
  - splatoon base (art) https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/splatoon/en/index.html
  - sonic adventure 2 menus (sonadow section) https://www.spriters-resource.com/gamecube/sonicadventure2battle/
  - mario kart wii menu (collection) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjNTdQHkRJY @ 1:43

### ToDo List (actual coding):
- Profile: finish adding content to the interests, music, and diary pages
  - biggest issue here is css and layout
- Profile: write a function to create entries for the diary (similar to the artwork thing)
  - i need to know how to css this before fully writing a script
- Shelf: layout the main menu page with the correct content (no gifs or images. might add later)
  - html and css the mini description with this
- Shelf: finish the information template page layout
- Shelf: transition for the popup (my braincells are dying trying to figure this out right now so ill add this later. but this is something i definitely want to add)
- Shelf: figure out how to do button select stuff. i know that when hovering, it shows the collection preview on the course selection section. when pressed the button should be depressed and the images should pop up with the blue highlighted text and clicking them brings up the popup. how to do back button? click anywhere on the screen to go back to select collection?
- move repeatable css into separate pages for less space (see mkwii section)
- css every page to be mobile friendly (after finishing everything else. last thing i need to do)

### ToDo List (asset creation):
- Index: what assets can i make for the buttons? (left right and generate)
- Art: create assets for the filter buttons (see the splatoon base website)
- Art: refine "artwork" sign (its too basic and isn't good lol)
- Art: create the background tag card thing for art (see splatoon website)
 - i want to use a random number generator to dictate how theyre rotated to create randomness in the tag spread
- Art: redo background pattern
- Art2: the art bg boxes, define border and just loop the lines inside. should be the menu boxes from the game

### Thought About:
- would moving the credits to the index be a better idea? easier to access
- falling out of love of the spacehey theme, but idk if theres a better one. might make it look like a custom template instead
- move the comments thing to the profile?
- audios for websites with inspirations that could be enhanced w them??!! and maybe a speaker thing at the bottom to mute and unmute!! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63546265/how-to-make-music-autoplay-and-loop-in-background/63546549
- main art section no longer makes sense to me lmao, will probably end up changing it to something else

### Maintenence:
- Index: add in more songs i listen to
- Art: add in newer artworks
- Shelf: add in new collection items
