I'm tired of Neocities and Carrd restrictions. At least I get to learn some HTML and discover that I don't actualy despise CSS. Also the large commit number is because I was directly editing code on here, but after learning that GitPages takes 10 minutes to update I decided to stop abusing GitHub and edit stuff in Aptana Studio 3.

### Easy stuff (Barely any braincells):
- CSS OC page like the Collection and SSCrossover pages?
  - Depends on whether there is a lot of information on it, probably better just to have it normally done like with images on the top
- Find a cool font for each text type
### Real ToDo List (Requires braincells):
-ReCSS the About Me to be *unique* slay
-  CSS the game pages for the CC
  - BGs for these should be unique to each game, layouts can be similar
- CSS the blog
  - Also needs layout
  - Might remove or reuse this page for something else
- Add more into the Cringe Corner landing
### Vic use braincells to make website usable (IMPOSSIBLE):
- Homepage needs a completely separate layout
- SSCrossover and Collection also need separate layouts
  - Images here can be put under the corresponding text (flex-direction: row to flex-direction: column)
- The rest of the pages can be display:flex'd into mobile layouts
### Tedious Manual Labor:
- Fix text sizes for each page
- Upload more images for art page
- Add OC information and images
- Add SSCrossover information and images
  - Wikipedia uses float right?
- Add Collection information and images
- Add About Me information and images
