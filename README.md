I'm tired of Neocities and Carrd restrictions. At least I get to learn some HTML and discover that I despise CSS.

To do list:
- Figure out width stuff in the index page
- Add bg and background colors to the index page
- CSS the art page, add my art to the buttons
- Finish creating all linked art pages
- Organize and CSS about me
- Upload and link my art properly to their respective pages (+CSS it)
- CSS the blog

- OC page information:
  - Main oc's have their own page and backstory, with their own art. Main page with art of said franchise has their art up as well.

... and finally, make mobile CSS layouts.
