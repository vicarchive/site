I'm tired of Neocities and Carrd restrictions. The large commit number is because I was directly editing code on here, but after learning that GitPages takes 10 minutes to update I decided to stop abusing GitHub and edit stuff in Aptana Studio 3.
<br /><br />

###Required ASAP
- change all website links to internal html file links. just in case i have to move from github :P
### Easy stuff (Barely any braincells):
- update art page more than once every two months
### Real ToDo List (Requires braincells):
- Finish ReCSS'ing the About Me page (spoilers it will be awesome)
-  CSS the game pages for the CC
  - BGs for these should be unique to each game, layouts can be similar
- Make the blog look cooler? idk it's kind of bland
- Add more into the Cringe Corner landing
  - This should be a large infodump of things i know rather than only sonic wiki regurtitation
### Vic use braincells to make website usable (IMPOSSIBLE):
- i wanna redo the homepage to be more like a cringy 00s blog. scrolly.
- make the 'wiki' pages more cool.. theyre boring to read through
- mobile EVERYTHING
### Tedious Manual Labor:
- Fix text sizes and fonts for each page
- Complete OC page
- Complete SSCrossover
- Complete Collection
- Complete About Me

##Why did I make this?
I have a hard time using social media, but I wish to upload my artwork somewhere. The idea of my own website has gone from an extended biography on an Instagram page, to a Sonic lore website, to hosting my art on a platform that I can customize, but ultimately it has culminated into what I want to call an archive of my existence. Hopefully it is something you can somewhat enjoy.
