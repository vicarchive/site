I'm tired of Neocities and Carrd restrictions. At least I get to learn some HTML and discover that I despise CSS. Also the large commit number is because I was directly editing code in GitHub, but after learning that GitPages take 10 minutes to update I decided to work with GitHub correctly and edit in Aptana Studio 3.

To do list:
- Figure out width stuff in the index page
- Add bg and background colors to the index page
- CSS the art page, add my art to the buttons
- Finish creating all linked art pages
- Organize and CSS about me
- Upload and link my art properly to their respective pages (+CSS it)
- CSS the blog
- Put the Shadow overlay image somewhere

- OC page information:
  - Main oc's have their own page and backstory, with their own art. Main page with art of said franchise has their art up as well.

... and finally, make mobile CSS layouts.
