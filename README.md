I'm tired of Neocities and Carrd restrictions. At least I get to learn some HTML and discover that I despise CSS. Also the large commit number is because I was directly editing code on here, but after learning that GitPages take 10 minutes to update I decided to stop abusing GitHub and edit stuff in Aptana Studio 3.
<br /><br />
To do list (Requires braincells):
- Organize and CSS about me
- CSS the blog
  - Also needs layout
  - Might remove or reuse this page for something else
- CSS Cringe Corner
  - Basically is a port of my infodumps about SA1 and 2 from the NeoCities page, maybe could include some other cringe stuff in there
<br /><br />
Tedious Manual Labor:
- Upload lower quality art I guess, or originals on GD
- Add Artwork information and images
  - With OC Art
- Add OC information and images
- Add SSCrossover information and images
- Add Collection information and images
<br /><br />
Vic use braincells to make website usable (IMPOSSIBLE):
- Homepage needs a completely separate layout
- SSCrossover and Collection also need separate layouts
- The rest of the pages can be display:flex'd into mobile layouts
