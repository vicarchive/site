welcome to my website!! i wanted a place where i could add in my work in a way i wanted to without space restrictions or premade templates, and as a bonus i get to learn html, css and js!! and maybe some more sql..
the large commit number is from the early development cuz i was editing stuff directly on github. i use aptana studio 3 now :D

## Website Plans
### Plans:
- themes for the website:
  - dreamcast web browser (index) https://youtu.be/oL1Pxek3sss
  - myspace (profile) https://spacehey.com/profile?id=2620231
  - splatoon base (art) https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/splatoon/en/index.html
  - sonic adventure 2 menus (sonadow section) https://www.spriters-resource.com/gamecube/sonicadventure2battle/
  - frutiger aero metal (showcase) [i need this link]

### ToDo List (actual coding):
- Index: css the updates box a little so it looks cooler and is more functional
- Profile: get a different discord logo or cut down the sides on this one

- Profile: finish adding content to the interests, music, and diary pages
- - biggest issue here is css
- Profile: write a function to create entries for the diary (similar to the artwork thing)
- - i need to know how to css this before fully writing a script
- Shelf: figure out structure for collection items
- Shelf: css the boxes for the information (see early ios apps)

- css every page to be mobile friendly (after finishing everything else. last thing i need to do)

### ToDo List (asset creation):
- Art: create assets for the filter buttons (see the splatoon base website)
- Art: refine "artwork" sign (its too basic and isn't good lol)
- Art: create the background tag card thing for art (see splatoon website)
- - i want to use a random number generator to dictate how theyre rotated to create randomness in the tag spread
- Art: redo background pattern
- Art2: the art bg boxes, define border and just loop the lines inside. should be the menu boxes from the game
- Shelf: make bubble assets for shelf information (basically add the text on top of the bubbles. see frutier aero or make icons)
- Shelf: create asset for the top header (see ios apps? idk if i need an asset for it)
- Shelf: create the assets for the information boxes (is there a way to frutiger aero the boxes with info in them?)

### Thought About:
- would moving the credits to the index be a better idea? easier to access
- falling out of love of the spacehey theme, but idk if theres a better one. might make it look like a custom template instead
- move the comments thing to the profile?

### Maintenence:
- Index: add in more songs i listen to
- Art: add in newer artworks
- Shelf: add in new collection items
