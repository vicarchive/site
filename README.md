I'm tired of Neocities and Carrd restrictions. At least I get to learn some HTML and discover that I despise CSS. Also the large commit number is because I was directly editing code in GitHub, but after learning that GitPages take 10 minutes to update I decided to stop abusing GitHub and edit stuff in Aptana Studio 3.

To do list:
- CSS the art page, add my art to the buttons
  - Add some color to the elements
- Finish creating all linked art pages
- Organize and CSS about me
  - Need to draft layout
- Upload and link my art properly to their respective pages (+CSS it)
- CSS the blog
  - Also needs layout

- OC page information:
  - Main oc's have their own page and backstory, with their own art. Main page with art of said franchise has their art up as well.

... and finally, make mobile CSS layouts.
