Welcome to VicArchive. I'm Vic and I'm archiving my existence in a place with complete creative freedom.
The large commit number is because I was previously directly editing code on here, but after learning that GitPages takes 10 minutes to update I decided to stop abusing GitHub and edit stuff in Aptana Studio 3.

## Website Plans
### To Keep in Mind:
- themes for the website:
  - dreamcast web browser (index)
  - myspace (profile)
  - sa2 (art)
  - sonadow (sonadow section)
  - frutiger aero metal (showcase)

### ToDo List:
- Index: find some more random stuff to put on there, maybe some images
- Art: add the filter thing back in from the legacy site and css it

### General:
- find some fonts to use on each page
- oc pages can be linked to the art page
- find some assets to use for css on all the pages
	- profile is probably just going to be straight css theme images
