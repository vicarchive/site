Welcome to VicArchive. I'm Vic and I'm archiving my existence in a place with complete creative freedom.
The large commit number is because I was previously directly editing code on here, but after learning that GitPages takes 10 minutes to update I decided to stop abusing GitHub and edit stuff in Aptana Studio 3.

## Website Plans
### Easy stuff:
- finish html and css for unfinished pages
- create different folders for different website themes (this is gonna have to be done manually w pages like /vicarchive/frutiger/index.html and /vicarchive/dreamcast/index.html and theyre all gonna have to be updated MANUALLY guh)
  - dreamcast web browser / y2k
  - frutiger aero
  - sonadow
  - sa2 (default)

### Active ToDo List (Default):
- Index: update
- About Me:
  - finish adding info and making it less bland (use those posters as active reference)
- Cringe Corner:
  - add more into the landing page
    - dude, make the buttons like cool previews of the things youre gonna talk about, super cool
  - BGs for the pages should be unique to each game, layouts can be similar
- Dump:
  - Make the blog look cooler? idk it's kind of bland rn
- Website:
  - mainly the index page, but redo anything to be mobile friendly
  - for each page that has a specific look or theme to it, the upper portion - the wayfinding part - should match the theme. otherwise it will remain as the sa2 sky
    - for special pages only. themes will not apply to them (like splatchao lore page)

### Stuff I Need to Clarify:
- make the 'wiki' pages more cool.. theyre boring to read through
  - okay??? and what do you want to do now??

### Too Much Work:
- Fix text sizes and fonts for each page
  - :/ you need some kind of font database to test out
  - not every page needs to be consistent with the index. youre not making a corporate website, youre making a functional portfolio
    - but each page needs to be consistent with itself unless its an exception (very rare)
- Complete OC page
  - you need oc information first, dummy
  - add spiky and spimmy
- Complete SSCrossover
  - again, you need the lore
  - also you shouldnt use all of your art on this website since some of it is literally concept art. but use complete updated official art. but you need to figure out what you want your characters to do first. maybe jot down bullet points before infodumping on something you dont know
  - also the layout kind of sucks i want something more dynamic like the splatoon website
- Complete Collection
  - you need pictures bozo!!!
  - take out the sonic vs not sonic filtering.. it sucks
    - instead you should filter by types of things, like video games, then plush toys, then action figures, etc.
