I'm tired of Neocities and Carrd restrictions. At least I get to learn some HTML and discover that I despise CSS. Also the large commit number is because I was directly editing code in GitHub, but after learning that GitPages take 10 minutes to update I decided to stop abusing GitHub and edit stuff in Aptana Studio 3.
<br /><br />
To do list:
- Upload lower quality art I guess, or originals on GD
- Add my artwork into the art page
  - Includes OC work
- Add OC information and images
- Figure out why SSCrossover position:sticky refuses to work
- Make the links in the Collection page not underlined
- Organize and CSS about me
- CSS the blog
  - Also needs layout
- Add information and images to Collection page
- CSS Cringe Corner
  - Basically is a port of my infodumps about SA1 and 2 from the NeoCities page, maybe could include some other cringe stuff in there
<br /><br />
... and finally, make mobile CSS layouts.
- Homepage needs a completely separate layout
- SSCrossover and Collection need separate layouts
- The rest of the pages can be display:flex'd into mobile layouts
