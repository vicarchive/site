  <h2>Art Stuff</h2>
      <p>I make a decent amount of creative things for a variety of different interests (spoiler alert: all of them are video games).</p>
  <h3>Sonic</h3>
  <p>Will make a separate webpage for this.<p>
  <h3>Splatoon</h3>
  <p>Will also make a separate webpage for this.<p>
  <h3>Rayman</h3>
  <p>Nothing yet, though I do enjoy playing Rayman 2 often, I've finished the game more than 10 times.</p>
