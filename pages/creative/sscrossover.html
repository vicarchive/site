    <h1 id="top">Splachao (Codename: SSCrossover)</h1>
      <p>I'm keeping this page as an archive. It will be updated as soon as I finalize the designs of all of my characters (not soon).<br><br>This is my magnum opus. I'll detail some of my things here and I'll add previous designs and ideas I had, but I'll explain some stuff here:<p>
    <h2 id="worldbuilding">Worldbuilding</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<p>The premise is that the chao of the Sonic universe (which I will be referring to as Mobius) survived a life ending event. Sage helps them initially and they evolve into Mobian looking creatures similar to how Inklings evolved to be humanoid. However, to explain the character chao in SA2, the chaos energy of one of the Sonic gang sometimes settles upon a chao and causes it to turn into a character chao of the Mobian the energy belongs to, albeit with some changes because of evolution and chao structures.</p>
      <p>Something else that exists in this universe is the presence of chaos bonds, which is kind of like the ability to transfer power and feelings through their beings to someone else. Usually these are formed pretty early on in a chao's life and the bond must be kept intact to become stronger. It is possible to completely break it.</p>
      <p>Because the chaos chao evolved into Mobians, they are able to turn into water puddles, similar to Chaos. They can't use water powers because they have a lesser grasp on powerful chaos energy, but guns allow them to do so. Their specials are similar to that of Chaos' powers, but much weaker for balance.</p>
    <h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<h3 id="sonic">Sonic</h3>
    	<p>Sonic in this universe replaces Callie as part of the initial game's idol duo. He is energetic, charismatic, fun to be around, and always happy to break out into song and dance. He is based off of the Sonic chao that is obtainable ingame, and he has Mobian Sonic's chaos energy. Team codename is Falcon.</p>
    	<h3 id="shadow">Shadow</h3>
    	<p>Shadow in this universe replaces Marie as part of the initial game's idol duo. He is calm, sarcastic, and a little cynical - he won't pass up the opportunity to bring the harsh reality back on the head of an optimist. He is based off of the Shadow chao that is obtainable ingame, and he has Mobian Shadow's chaos energy.</p>
    	<h3 id="knuckles">Knuckles</h3>
    	<p>This universe is slightly different in terms of lore, but he can be considered as the inuniverse counterpart to Captain Cuttlefish. He is the leader of the team of four watching out for the society they live in. He is the one who manages most of their missions, and he may be a little more than smitten with Rouge. He has Mobian Knuckles' chaos energy. Codename is Captain.</p>
    	<h3 id="tails">Tails</h3>
    	<p>Sonic's childhood friend and genius mechanic, replaces Sheldon. He runs the weapons shop at the ripe age of 15, as well as upgrading the hero weapons for the player in the story mode. He is based off of the Tails chao that was obtainable in SA2, and has Tails' chaos energy. Team codename is General.</p>
    	<h3 id="rouge">Rouge</h3>
    	<p>A excellent spy and initially an acquaintance of Knuckles who joins in on their team. She is very aware about his lttle crush on her, not like she doesn't reciprocate, but she has work to do. I created her chao design myself, and she has Mobian Rouge's chaos energy. Team codename is Lovebomb.</p>
    	<h3 id="dreggman">Dr. Eggman</h3>
    	<p>Yep, he's back. Before the end of the Mobian world as he knew it, he cryogenically froze himself to escape certain death so that he could have another chance at ruling the world. Unfortunately, by the time he woke back up, the world was now full with evolved chaos, and the Sonic team seems to have reincarnated into them... somehow. He communicates to the chao with a translator.</p>
    	<h3 id="amy">Amy</h3>
    	<h3 id="blaze">Blaze</h3>
    	<p>Blaze in this universe replaces Marina as part of the second story's idol duo. She was created by Eggman in an attempt to find the cause of his former enemies reappearing, but due to some errors in manmade chaos energy implantation, she came out a little different - she's taller and doesn't resemble regular Blaze as much. Because of her past in Eggman's care, she is fluent in English and prefers to sing in English when she performs. She is able to speak in the chao language, but she messes up sometimes and blurts out the English words instead. She has Blaze's chaos energy.</p>
    	<h3 id="jet">Jet</h3>
    	<h3 id="wave">Wave</h3>
    	<h3 id="storm">Storm</h3>
    	<h3 id="sage">Sage</h3>
    	<p>Both of her family members were frozen, and she watched the Mobian world end alone. The chaos chao that were left began to thrive under her care as they evolved into what resembled the previous inhabitants of the planet. She is able to speak their language fluently. Sage quickly became a background character in chao history, but she was banned from interacting with them when Eggman began plotting his first attack. Eventually, she is able to help them when they stumble upon the old lands (Alterna). Her knowledge of the chao language helped build the translator Eggman uses in the first story to talk to them.</p>
    	<h3 id="metal">Metal Sonic</h3>
    <h2 id="story">Storylines</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<h3 id="1story">1st Story (Splatoon 1)</h3>
    	<p>The Squid Sisters in this game are replaced by Sonic and Shadow, I don't have an idea for their group name yet. They are not related, but they do have a pretty strong chaos bond because they basically grew up together. They become idols, which is basically Sonic's childhood dream. Regarding the story mode, Sonic is a part of the New Squidbeak Splatoon (name not thought up of yet) along with the weapons shopkeeper that he's known since childhood, Tails, and an upperclassman they dragged into their group at some point in middle school, Knuckles. Knuckles is the leader of the group and recruited a spy named Rouge that he desperately tries to hide his care for. Tails is able to upgrade weapons and bombs. Sonic throughout the story mode tries to recruit Shadow, but Knuckles is skeptical about having two celebrities in his troupe. Sonic brings him in during the final battle anyway and they win against Eggman.</p>
      <p>I still need to sort out Eggman's motives, but he is here because he cryogenically froze himself and Metal similar to how Judd exists in Splatoon. Sage is here too but she technically lives in technology so she stayed alive regardless of the extinction event. They cannot speak the language chao do, so Eggman invents a translator based on Sage's knowledge of the language that she has gathered over the years (she can speak it).</p>
    	<h3 id="2story">2nd Story (Splatoon 2)</h3>
    	<p>Sonic and Shadow drift away after their peak and get popular on their own. However, Sonic goes MIA and Shadow has a terrible feeling about it, which is when he recruits the player character so that they can go find him before Knuckles and his team does. They find him first, and Sonic has been pretty much manipulated into joining Eggman's cause. Knuckles and Rouge are not far behind, but at that point Shadow confronts Sonic and attempts to remind him of their progress and happiness together by song. After performing the inkantation, Sonic watches Eggman fly away without him in a hurry, and Shadow brings him back to explain what had just happened, which confuses Sonic but ultimately convinces him that Eggman wasn't friends with him.</p>
    	<h3 id="3story">3rd Story (Splatoon 3)</h3>
    	<p>Using information he was given under Eggman's influence, Sonic brings the group to the entrance of a cave. After another confrontation with Eggman, they make their way in and are trapped. Sage greets them with joy, and shows them around what she refers to as "the old world", which consists of old locations that Mobian Sonic and Co traversed. They gradually learn about the past and find out their origins. However, when they find a chaos emerald, they activate the ARK laser by accident and must destroy it. Eggman, who has already gone through this before, realizes that they don't deserve to die and uses a smaller version of the Death Egg to help destroy the colony once and for all. Shadow finds a picture of his Mobian self with Maria.</p>
    <h2 id="devdetails">Development Details</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<p>While I was bored in Linear Algebra, I had been suffering through some awful art block and I hadn't drawn Sonic and Shadow because my brain was fixed on Splatoon. So the genius idea was making my two favorite hedgehogs as my two favorite Splatoon idols. And from that spawned over 2 months of planning, lore, designs, and other stuff that probably will amount to wasted time.</p>
    	<p>Sonic and Shadow's designs took nearly 2 months to finalize.</p>
    <h2 id="extra">Extras</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<p>Another note: chao don't have gender, so I didn't feel the need to include gender into these characters. They may and do lean towards a gender presentation and prefer specific pronouns, but they are not of a particular gender and don't have a strong concept of it.</p>
    	<p>Sonic speaks in English when manipulated, and it is translated through the same translator Eggman uses. He begins to remember the chao language after Shadow joins in to sing, and pretty much remembers all of it when he sings the Calamari Inkantation.</p>
