    <h1 id="top">Splachao (Codename: SSCrossover)</h1>
      <p>This is my magnum opus. I'll detail some of my things here and I'll add previous designs and ideas I had, but I'll explain some stuff here:<p>
    <h2 id="worldbuilding">Worldbuilding</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<p>The premise is that the chao of the Sonic universe (which I will be referring to as Mobius) survived a life ending event. Sage helps them initially and they evolve into Mobian looking creatures similar to how Inklings evolved to be humanoid. However, to explain the character chao in SA2, the chaos energy of one of the Sonic gang sometimes settles upon a chao and causes it to turn into a character chao of the Mobian the energy belongs to, albeit with some changes because of evolution and chao structures.</p>
      <p>Something else that exists in this universe is the presence of chaos bonds, which is kind of like the ability to transfer power and feelings through their beings to someone else. Usually these are formed pretty early on in a chao's life and the bond must be kept intact to become stronger. It is possible to completely break it.</p>
      <p>Because the chaos chao evolved into Mobians, they are able to turn into water puddles, similar to Chaos. They can't use water powers because they have a lesser grasp on powerful chaos energy, but guns allow them to do so. Their specials are similar to that of Chaos' powers, but much weaker for balance.</p>

    <h2 id="story">Storylines</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<h3 id="1story">1st Story (Splatoon 1)</h3>
    	<p>The Squid Sisters in this game are replaced by Sonic and Shadow, I don't have an idea for their group name yet. They are not related, but they do have a pretty strong chaos bond because they basically grew up together. They become idols, which is basically Sonic's childhood dream. Regarding the story mode, Sonic is a part of the New Squidbeak Splatoon (name not thought up of yet) along with the weapons shopkeeper that he's known since childhood, Tails, and an upperclassman they dragged into their group at some point in middle school, Knuckles. Knuckles is the leader of the group and recruited a spy named Rouge that he desperately tries to hide his care for. Tails is able to upgrade weapons and bombs. Sonic throughout the story mode tries to recruit Shadow, but Knuckles is skeptical about having two celebrities in his troupe. Sonic brings him in during the final battle anyway and they win against Eggman.</p>
      <p>I still need to sort out Eggman's motives, but he is here because he cryogenically froze himself and Metal similar to how Judd exists in Splatoon. Sage is here too but she technically lives in technology so she stayed alive regardless of the extinction event. They cannot speak the language chao do, so Eggman invents a translator based on Sage's knowledge of the language that she has gathered over the years (she can speak it).</p>
    	<h3 id="2story">2nd Story (Splatoon 2)</h3>
    	<h3 id="3story">3rd Story (Splatoon 3)</h3>
    <h2 id="devdetails">Development Details</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<p>While I was bored in Linear Algebra, I had been suffering through some awful art block and I hadn't drawn Sonic and Shadow because my brain was fixed on Splatoon. So the genius idea was making my two favorite hedgehogs as my two favorite Splatoon idols. And from that spawned over 2 months of planning, lore, designs, and other stuff that probably will amount to wasted time.</p>
    <h2 id="extra">Extras</h2>
    	<div class="horiz"></div>
    	<p>Another note: chao don't have gender, so I didn't feel the need to include gender into these characters. They may and do lean towards a gender presentation and prefer specific pronouns, but they are not of a particular gender and don't have a strong concept of it.</p>
