<h1>The Dump</h1>
<p>I'll post random stuff in here, mostly like text entries, I guess.</p>
<button type="button" class="collapse">Entry #1, 08/26/2023</button>
<div class="inside">
		<p>I'm studying abroad in Singapore. It's cool and all, and it's a lot safer than any other city you can go to (I'm looking at you, San Francisco). No trash anywhere.</p>
		<p>But I feel very bored here. I've seen everything the week before classes and I don't really know what to do with my spare time. I come to a cafe to work on my art and this website but there's not much else for me to do when the place closes at 6:30.</p>
		<p>I've just been going to the airport a lot to roam around there. Jewel is pretty cool.</p>
