    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Vic, I'm 19 and this is my third attempt at an archiving site. I'm trying to stay off of social media (except YouTube) so I hope I'll stick with updating this thing.</p>
        <p>I am a math major going to Cal Poly and I primarily like to work on art stuff like drawing and animating. I prefer to draw in Procreate, and I animate in Adobe After Effects with Duik Bassel 2 (learning Angela). I'm also getting familiar with Adobe Animate, thanks Plus7.</p>
        <p>You can find some of my animated work on my YouTube channel when I link it.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In addition to my interest in the arts, I am also a little bit of a weirdo. I am a huge Sonic fan since late March of 2020, and my favorite character is Shadow. I tend to draw Sonadow because it makes me happy. Anyway, some other stuff I like are Splatoon and Rayman. I know how to do most of the dances in the Splatoon games.</p>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>I like to play a lot of video games, as if you couldn't tell. I tend to go for rhythm games and calmer story based games, but my favorites are Sonic Adventure (1 and 2), Rayman 2, Splatoon (1 and 2), Sonic 06...</p>
    <h2>Socials</h2>
        <p>Hey hey hey, I have a tendency to never have a concrete place to put my energy or work in. I have plenty of aliases that may appear unrelated, but I am all the same.</p>
