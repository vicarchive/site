    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
    <div class="horiz"></div>
        <p>Hey, my name is Vic, I'm 19 and this is my third attempt at an archiving site. I'm not using much social media nowadays so I hope that I'll be able to update this as a sort of journal of what I make and think up of.</p>
        <p>I am a math major going to Cal Poly and I primarily like to work on art stuff like drawing and animating. I prefer to draw in Procreate, and I animate in Adobe After Effects with Duik Bassel 2 (learning Angela). I'm also getting familiar with Adobe Animate, thanks Plus7.</p>
        <p>My creative ventures are under the "Creative Works" tab on the home page.</p>
    <h2 id="videogames">Video Games</h2>
    <div class="horiz"></div>
        <p>I play lots of video games when I have true spare time (not required to do homework at some point in the next few days). Some of my favorites include the Sonic franchise - I'm pretty bad at the levels but finding the memory things in Sonic Frontiers was really fun - Splatoon - really just the first two, I don't have much fun playing the third despite the fact that I like its style - Rayman - the second game mostly, I have too much skill issue for the third - Sam &amp; Max - though I haven't been investing much time into those recently - and rhythm games - I've had to give it up because of a developing stress injury in my left hand. Some notable favorites include Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Splatoon 1 and 2, Rayman 2, osu!, Etterna, Sonic '06, and Sonic Riders.</p>
    <h2 id-"interests">Interests</h2>
    <div class="horiz"></div>
        <p>In addition to the franchises of the video games listed above, I have a few other Grass Touching stuff I spend some time on - most of my time is spent on making artwork for various things I like, usually of said franchises. As previously stated, I also like to animate in rare cases and do so with AE and Duik Bassel 2. I've done some tweening and frame by frame work in Animate but I don't really like the layer structures, even if it is very easy to keyframe things. I also like to dance, but this is exclusively of the ingame Splatoon dances. I also know all the lyrics to said songs I dance to. I am also very intrigued on 'retro' consoles and console restorations. I own a few Gen 5 and 6 consoles and they are my prized possessions (other than my F4F Sonic statues...). I hope to have the fine motor skills to restore consoles at some point because they fascinate me. Also I play a lot of older video games and I enjoy them more than newer releases. I own every single Sonic GameCube game, complete with the manuals. About half have the yellow tag on the box art, but I don't really mind - I don't own them for aesthetic purposes.</p>
