    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
    <div class="horiz"></div>
        <p>Hey, my name is Vic, I'm 19 and this is my third attempt at an archiving site. I'm not using much social media nowadays so I hope that I'll be able to update this as a sort of journal of what I make and think up of.</p>
        <p>I am a math major going to Cal Poly and I primarily like to work on art stuff like drawing and animating. I prefer to draw in Procreate, and I animate in Adobe After Effects with Duik Bassel 2 (learning Angela). I'm also getting familiar with Adobe Animate, thanks Plus7.</p>
        <p>My creative ventures are under the "Creative Works" tab on the home page.</p>
    <h2 id="videogames">Video Games</h2>
    <div class="horiz"></div>
        <p>I play lots of video games when I have true spare time (not required to do homework at some point in the next few days). Some of my favorites include the Sonic franchise - I'm pretty bad at the levels but finding the memory things in Sonic Frontiers was really fun - Splatoon - really just the first two, I don't have much fun playing the third despite the fact that I like its style - Rayman - the second game mostly, I have too much skill issue for the third - Sam &amp; Max - though I haven't been investing much time into those recently - and rhythm games - I've had to give it up because of a developing stress injury in my left hand. Some notable favorites include Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Splatoon 1 and 2, Rayman 2, osu!, Etterna, Sonic '06, and Sonic Riders.</p>
    <h2 id-"interests">Interests</h2>
    <div class="horiz"></div>
        <p>Obviously the video games are part of my interests, but I also have Grass Touching stuff that I spend some time on - I make a lot of fanart for the video games I play or am interested in, as well as my own stuff I create. I also puppet animate sometimes and rarely make frame by frame stuff as concept art. I can do the ingame Splatoon dances (as Callie, Marina, or Frye), and know all of the jibberish lyrics. One of my biggest, non fandom related interests, is video game consoles. I own a few Gen 5 and 6 consoles and they're my prized possessions (behind the F4F statues I have..). Hopefully I'll be able to develop the fine motor skills to restore them, as that is also a hobby I'd like to take up. I own every single Sonic GameCube game, full in box.</p>

    <p>Also, shoutout to the most goated math professor on the Cal Poly campus for indirectly showing me that Github can host websites.</p>
