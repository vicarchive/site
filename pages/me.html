    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Vic, I'm 19 and this is my third attempt at an archiving site. I'm not using much social media nowadays so I hope that I'll be able to update this as a sort of journal of what I make and think up of.</p>
        <p>I am a math major going to Cal Poly and I primarily like to work on art stuff like drawing and animating. I prefer to draw in Procreate, and I animate in Adobe After Effects with Duik Bassel 2 (learning Angela). I'm also getting familiar with Adobe Animate, thanks Plus7.</p>
        <p>My creative ventures are under the "Creative Works" tab on the home page.</p>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>I play lots of video games when I have true spare time (not required to do homework at some point in the next few days). Some of my favorites include the Sonic franchise - I'm pretty bad at the levels but finding the memory things in Sonic Frontiers was really fun - Splatoon - really just the first two, I don't have much fun playing the third despite the fact that I like its style - Rayman - the second game mostly, I have too much skill issue for the third - Sam & Max - though I haven't been investing much time into those recently - and rhythm games - I've had to give it up because of a developing stress injury in my left hand. Some notable favorites include Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Splatoon 1 and 2, Rayman 2, osu!, Etterna, Sonic '06, and Sonic Riders.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In addition to the franchises of the video games listed above, I have a few other Grass Touching stuff I spend some time on - most of my time is spent on making artwork for various things I like, usually of said franchises. As previously stated, I also like to animate in rare cases and do so with AE and Duik Bassel 2. I've done some tweening and frame by frame work in Animate but I don't really like the layer structures, even if it is very easy to keyframe things. I also like to dance, but this is exclusively of the ingame Splatoon dances. I also know all the lyrics to said songs I dance to. I am also very intrigued on 'retro' consoles and console restorations. I own a few Gen 5 and 6 consoles and they are my prized possessions (other than my F4F Sonic statues...). I hope to have the fine motor skills to restore consoles at some point because they fascinate me. Also I play a lot of older video games and I enjoy them more than newer releases. I own every single Sonic GameCube game, complete with the manuals. About half have the yellow tag on the box art, but I don't really mind - I don't own them for aesthetic purposes.</p>
    <h2>Socials</h2>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
    <p>Just some random stuff I'd like to put out there, I guess.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I've watched Charlie (penguinz0) for a while, since late 2019. While I absolutely admire his growth into who he is now and his contributions to the community, he has settled into less of niche content and more of mainstream drama content. To be fair, he has been treading over there for a while, but I'm not really into daily drama because there's so much of it nowadays and niche stuff has always been more interesting to me.</li>
      <li>I've started watching Joel Vinesauce. Unfortunately, it was because of Grand Dad. Thanks SiIva. (I also enjoy Vinny content, but Joel has my attention for now.)</li>
    </ul>
