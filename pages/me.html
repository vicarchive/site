    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Vic, I'm 19 and this is my third attempt at an archiving site. I'm not using much social media nowadays so I hope that I'll be able to update this as a sort of journal of what I make and think up of.</p>
        <p>I am a math major going to Cal Poly and I primarily like to work on art stuff like drawing and animating. I prefer to draw in Procreate, and I animate in Adobe After Effects with Duik Bassel 2 (learning Angela). I'm also getting familiar with Adobe Animate, thanks Plus7.</p>
        <p>My creative ventures are under the "Creative Works" tab on the home page.</p>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>I play lots of video games when I have true spare time (not required to do homework at some point in the next few days). Some of my favorites include the Sonic franchise - I'm pretty bad at the levels but finding the memory things in Sonic Frontiers was really fun - Splatoon - really just the first two, I don't have much fun playing the third despite the fact that I like its style - Rayman - the second game mostly, I have too much skill issue for the third - and rhythm games - I've had to give it up because of a developing stress injury in my left hand. Some notable favorites include Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Splatoon 1 and 2, Rayman 2, osu!, Etterna, Sonic '06, and Sonic Riders.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In addition to the franchises of the video games listed above, I have a few other Grass Touching stuff I spend some time on - most of my time is spent on making artwork for various things I like, usually of said franchises. As previously stated, I also like to animate in rare cases and do so with AE and Duik Bassel 2. I've done some tweening and frame by frame work in Animate but I don't really like the layer structures, even if it is very easy to keyframe things. I also like to dance, but this is exclusively of the ingame Splatoon dances. I also know all the lyrics to said songs I dance to.</p>
    <h2>Socials</h2>
        <p>A compilation of various accounts I keep for my fragmented presence online.</p>
