  <p>My collection consists of primarily Sonic items. I do have some related things (ex: Dreamcast games that are not Sonic) that I also wish to show off. Since the Sonic category will dominate most of this page, I'll split things up into Sonic and Other, and they'll both have their respective subsections that can be jumped to. Images will be there soon and I'll add information when I get home.</p>
  <h2 id="sonic">Sonic</h2>
	<div class="horiz"></div>
  <p>From March 2020 onwards, I have been in the Sonic fandom one way or another, but I have only really begun collecting Sonic items after April of 2021. In this section, I'll be detailing specifically Sonic things - should they relate to anything not explicitly Sonic, there will be a link to their place in the Other section.</p>
  <h3 id="sonicdcgames">Dreamcast Games</h3>
  <p>Redirects to the Dreamcast page.</p>
  <p>I obtained my Dreamcast in June or July of 2021, and my first Dreamcast Sonic game was Sonic Adventure 2.</p>
  <p>Although my first copy wasn't readable by the Dreamcast lazer (an issue arising from the GD-ROM format the Dreamcast uses for its games) I obtained a CIB (complete in box) version not long after. I finished it on June 19th 2022 (for its birthday).</p>
  <h2>Other</h2>
